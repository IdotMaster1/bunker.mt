Hey! Long time, no blog! Since the last time I did a blog I have gotten a custom built PC, an R720 server, some Cisco CCNA and probably more that i'm forgetting. I use Arch btw. Arch has surprisingly never broke for me yet. I have experienced some bugs but I dont think they are Arch's fault. Maybe people who break their Arch install's just have a massive skill issue. I don't really know what to write for this blog but I have some blog ideas. Let's all hope that I wont forget about my blog and never make another one.
