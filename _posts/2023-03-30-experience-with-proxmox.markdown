Hey! I am writing about my experience with Proxmox. If you dont know what it is, Proxmox is a Linux virtualizer ISO that gives you a nice WebGUI that lets you make containers, vm's and other stuff that I dont use. I run it on my R720 and it is running pretty well. My R720 doesnt use alot of power while in "idle" (running 2 vm's), about 50-70 watts with a max of 110 watts during bootup, but different configurations lead to different power usage. The Proxmox WebGUI is super nice and simple to understand. It does give you a shell to Debian (since Proxmox is technically Debian), but it isn't really recommended to install anything on the system directly. I am currently making some services, I am testing a mining pool for crypto, XMPP and a Matrix server. With that I am also trying to make a little web interface that lets people like you (!) signup, and it will automatically make an account on the different services. Sorry if my english is bad rn my brain is melting since its night time, 23:33. See you in the bunker and have a good night if it's night time for you.
