Hey! I am bunkematty. I like doing shit with computers, ham radio and other stuff. This website was made with Jekyll as I didnt want to host my old, plain HTML site when I bought my domain (bunker.mt). I have a homelab (Currently *running* with an Cisco Cataylst switch and a Poweredge R720) that is extreamly based. Anyways, go read my blogs!
